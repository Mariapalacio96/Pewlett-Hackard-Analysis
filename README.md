# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this project is to analyse all the information we were given to determine who is retiring soon. Since this was a large data and it had employees that are corrently working with the company and others that are no longer with us, We worked trough this data to make less complicated the data.

We stared by creating the tables and making the relationship between the tables creating an schema as follows
